Chess Bots Project

5.) Problem Statement

There are multiple chess bots that exist, but we want to show an example of machine learning bots training off each other and demonstrate the learning process the bots will go through in order to be able to play chess and see wither they will be able to win at multiple skill levels. Demonstrating machine learning in real time.

6.) Proposed Solutions 

	We want to use multiple different machine learning process for different bots and have them learn off each other. To possibly have them face off against already existing chess bots to see how the newly trained bots will fair. 

7.) Novelty of the Work

	There exist many different chess bots, but we want to show an example of the learning process the bots will go through to play chess and the steps we will take to demonstrate the botâ€™s learning process.
